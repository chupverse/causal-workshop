<em>
In observational epidemiological studies, it is important to identify confounding factors to estimate the causal effect of exposure on the health event. There are various methods for selecting these factors, including selection based on graphs representing causal hypotheses between the different factors, exposure, and the health event (hypotheses developed from the literature and knowledge of the context). This identification strategy is implemented in the free software DAGitty. In this session, we will use concrete examples from epidemiological studies to illustrate the construction of a causal graph and its implementation in DAGitty.
